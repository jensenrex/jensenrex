### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer. I work at Infosys. 

ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Javascript, SQL, React & Spring...

I finished the Generations Australia Junior Web Developer bootcamp in October 2021. 

I am a 3rd party seller on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) USA. With a couple of business partners, we sell [our own brand](https://www.axsyon.com) of stunning designs of the coolest looking dust masks in the world. Selling private labelled products on Amazon is what I considered my "day job" before starting at Infosys. I was hired by the regional head of [Payoneer](https://www.payoneer.com/)'s South East Asia hub to teach their clients. A couple of my students have reached over US$400,000 in monthly sales. I mentor aspiring amazon entrepreneurs. 

I am a semi-professional poker player- I specialise in live poker tournaments. I have [won](https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=329839) more than **AU$240,000** at [THE STAR](https://www.star.com.au)...  and teach people how (I do coaching)!

I graduated from [Founder Institute](https://fi.co/). ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for co-founders and in the future, mentors! ðŸ”­ I was working on [Zensiti](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rRQ4KD9YGs06BTRQ6grvny_GDyeXY-Fe6GJbrKUgylw/edit?usp=sharing), an ecommerce tech startup, that'll transform homes into smarter, greener spaces. Can't wait to get back into it!

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been doing the Brazilian martial art, Capoeira, for 27 years. This is [me](https://youtu.be/tR7b4APOQB8)! **I believe I can fly!** [We](https://www.facebook.com/capoeiraph) (my instructors and I) teach at 5 orphanages in the Philippines and my [academy](https://www.capoeiraau.org/) is in Chatswood, NSW.
